# Custon Wake words for home assistant

## These were built using [These instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/create_wake_word/)

## Install

To install The Hey Alfred wake word, you must have a [Wyoming Satellite](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite) up and running.

You can choose where to initially download the files. I put them in the root directory, but we will be moving and renaming the files later.

1. SSH into your Pi
2. Run the following in your root or were you would like to have then on your system
   ```
   git https://github.com/JoshBlackstone/HeyAlfredWakeWord
   ```
